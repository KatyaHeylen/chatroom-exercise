# Chatroom JavaScript challenge

I've created a basic chatroom for cats (for those intelligent ones who can type on a keyboard of boss when boss doesn't see). 
Configured express and socket.io for node.

### Must features for this challenge were: 


Must-have features
- Make a UI that makes it easy for people to send messages in this chatroom.
- It must be possible to send a message to everyone or to yourself
- Make sure we can identify who sent the message through a username.
- We could make a local variable and prompt the user to choose a username
- We can then emit this username along with the sent message to keep track of who sent what.
- Make a list to show everyone who is connected to the chatroom
- Implement something funny! The sky is the limit! (it can be very simple if you want)
- For example, you could make a functionality to make someone else's font size obscurely small!
- You could implement a feature where you can speak with someone else's username
- AND SO MUCH MORE -> BE CREATIVE (and I was! :) 


That's how it looks:

Tell your cat that to run a server he needs to use `node server` command in your CLI. 
And let him or her enjoy the chatting!
